## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable)
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- System with systemd (Linux)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dev-services-manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Rust dependencies will be installed automatically
   ```

3. **Run in development mode**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Building Binaries

To create distributable binaries:

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run tauri build

# Cross-compile (requires additional setup)
npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

## Architecture

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
- **Service Management**: Direct systemctl integration for service control
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time service status checking
- **Log Retrieval**: Journalctl integration for service logs
- **Security**: Requires sudo privileges for service operations
- **Database**: SQLite for service tracking and configuration

### Frontend (SolidJS)
- **Reactive State**: Context-based state management
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties with JavaScript coordination
- **UI Components**: Custom button and card components with variants
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA support

### Key Technologies
- **Tauri**: Rust-based desktop app framework
- **SolidJS**: Reactive JavaScript library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Heroicons**: Beautiful SVG icons
- **Solid Toast**: Toast notifications

## Configuration

### Customizing Services

To add or modify services, update the service definitions in `src/services.rs`:

```rust
fn get_service_definitions() -> HashMap<String, String> {
    let mut services = HashMap::new();
    services.insert("your-service".to_string(), "your-service.service".to_string());
    // ... more services
    services
}
```

### Theme Customization

Themes can be customized in `src/index.css` by modifying CSS custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
  --background: 0 0% 100%;
  /* ... other variables */
}
```

## Security Considerations

- The application requires sudo privileges to manage system services
- All service operations are validated against a predefined list
- No arbitrary command execution is allowed
- Service names are sanitized before system calls
- Passwords are cached securely with automatic expiration
